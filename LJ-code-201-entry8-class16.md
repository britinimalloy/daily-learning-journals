# LJ Code 201 - Entry 8 (class 16, Monday 26June2017)

### So...busmall is done...

All things resubmit are over, along with the 301 entrance test...I'm still 1.69% shy of 90...not sure what to think about that. It's serious buckle-down time on the group project, hopefully all will turn out well. I am mentally and physically exhausted, I'm really looking forward to next week off. Hopefully it's the last week off for quite some time. This course has really killed me so far, I wish I'd been able to work with others more often and possibly have gotten more accomplished. Oh well, live and learn, I guess. Charts and storage were new, I'm not looking forward to doing it in our project. I really hope my teammates got this...
