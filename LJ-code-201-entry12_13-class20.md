# LJ Code 201 - Day 12 or 13 (class 20, Friday 30June2017)

### And it's still not over...

Today I woke up feeling worse than yesterday, which is saying something, because yesterday I thought I was almost done and could breathe a sigh of relief once presentations were over. I tried to take notes yesterday in prep for our practice presentation but they were not very welcome as someone else wanted to just wing it by pulling stuff out of their rear as that's how they do well with this sort of thing. We got some notes from Tracey and spent a little bit of time running through the presentation again. It sounded like we had it down as far as order of speaking and who was saying what. Then that didn't go as planned but we all talked and made it through the presentation. Now there's more work to do. It's almost as if I'm drowning all over again, what if I put in all this work during the class and put up with a lot of crap during project week to get to the end of class and move on only to not move on? I'm terrified that I went through all of this for nothing. I've been telling myself for weeks that this is all for Microsoft and if I can make it through this first class it will get better because getting back into this mindset and doing this work is something that I've not been doing for a few years. Everything went soft. I thought this first class was a major hurdle and making it over would be the hardest thing. Now I've put in a bunch of effort and it might still not be good enough. And there isn't time to teach me what I might need to move on. I know it's only because everyone wants to see me succeed and be able to come back, but shouldn't this have happened before I started class and go my hopes up that I just needed to make it through this one??
