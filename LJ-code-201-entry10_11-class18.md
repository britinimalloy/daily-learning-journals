# LJ Code 201 - Day 10 or 11 (class 18, Wednesday 28June2017)

### It's all for Microsoft...it's all for Microsoft...IT'S ALL FOR Microsoft

Today just fell apart. I learned that I apparently know nothing and can't come up with a decent idea to save my life. Just kidding, that's just how I feel right now. I don't think I learned anything other than if I end up on a team like this at Microsoft my career won't last long. I have not felt this belittled, worthless, and humiliated in quite some time. I don't know if it's a cultural thing or I'm just misunderstood, partially because I'm not always fantastic at explaining my ideas or being able to defend them effectively when I'm told it's too complicated and will make things too hard and take too long to implement. I guess these are all things I need to work on...
