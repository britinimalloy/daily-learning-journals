# LJ Code 201 - Day 9 or 10 (class 17, Tuesday 27June2017)

### Whew! Some roadblocks today!

We finally got to start coding on our projects, we each had a HTML page to work on then we spent the day mob-programming our app.js. We have most of the functionality done, except freaking local storage (which we all agree will be a bear) but I think we can get the rest done Wednesday, or at least mostly there. Then we get to play with CSS. There were times of the communication not reaching everyone because at least one (or) more points in the day we didn't understand what someone else was trying to explain so some ideas might have gotten thrown out because they were deemed too hard or would take too long...towards the end of the day two of us were tired and feeling silly so we got the giggles and somehow irritated the third person who kind of shut down for the last 45 minutes. Fortunately there's always the morning to figure out the real issue so as not to repeat it. I learned today that a submit button will not work unless the information it's trying to gather is in a form. I was also reminded that sometimes fresh eyes are necessary to see something in your code that is jacked up but that you're also not seeing. I'm sure there's other things, they're just escaping me at the moment...
