# LJ Code 201 - Entry 7 (class 15, Friday 23June2017)

### Wow! What a week!

Things are getting better now that I've gotten a lot caught up, I still have some resubmits to finish (oh busmall...the bane of my existence right now) and I will be doing the 301 test today, I hope I do well because not doing well on it and managing a 90% but NOT moving on would kill me...conversely, doing well but still ending under 90 would also kill me...so much stress, although I think I'm through the worst. Thanks to some awesome class/cohort-mates things are looking up and I think right now I'm managing the possibility of not moving on but I'm somehow able to lie to myself enough that I can pull this off...so it's not so bad...I hope
