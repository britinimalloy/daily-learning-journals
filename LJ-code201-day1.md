# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Today I learned that while I already knew some of this, I have a lot to practice and even more to learn. I found that I could make my code do more if I was willing to spend the time on code that we haven't covered or reviewed yet. I didn't want to spend too much time and go down the rat hole, so I decided to employ the K.I.S.S. method and keep my code as simple as possible while still completing the minimum requirements so as to get my code done on time.

I learned that the "Amazonians" I interviewed with just didn't ask me the right questions to suss out my ability to work in teams; I worked very well with a group of my classmates and we all had fun while doing it.

I also learned that to paste text, like urls, into bash, I can't just shift + insert like the hot key says, I also must hit function with them. I also got a lot of practice with the repository functions done through bash, such as status, commit, and push.
