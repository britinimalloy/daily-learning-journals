# LJ Code 201 - Day 3 (Monday 12June2017)

### Today was a class full of things I thought I knew but still need lots of review!

I seemed to go back and forth as to whether or not I understood the material, and at the current moment my brain is mush. This seems to be a commonality for me lately. LOL sleep is awesome...also, I had no idea that at least some of the web browsers are written in C++, but I guess it makes sense. A past C++ instructor once explained (forgive my crappy memory) that C++ compiled is closer to machine language than the other high-level languages which is why it is used a lot in the gaming industry.
