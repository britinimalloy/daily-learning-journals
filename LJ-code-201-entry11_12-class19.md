# LJ Code 201 - Day 11 or 12 (class 19, Thursday 29June2017)

### It's all for Microsoft...it's all for Microsoft...IT'S ALL FOR Microsoft...GROOOSFRAAABAAAAA...

Today went better, toward the end of the day when most of the heavy lifting was done...I still don't feel good about how little I was "allowed" to contribute, and how much was changed on me...But it's all done now so hopefully the presentation will go well and I will pass this class. I don't know what I will do if I don't, I was already feeling like the Apprenti program may be my last hope for gainful employment. I really hope this "group" experience doesn't screw this up for me. I tried to help at many times, but even stuff that happened during the planning phase is coming back to me. They were signs. I should have listened. My ideas were too complicated or someone else had a "better" idea and while it looks like my approach may have ended up being better, as the object of objects instead of array of objects, was one of those. I tried many times to show them code, even in the planning stages, of how I did things in previous assignments to show how my ideas might work...but it's over, the project is done and works. And hopefully I will be moving on. I think if I learned anything this week, it's how difficult groups can be.
