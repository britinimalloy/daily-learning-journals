# LJ Code 201 - Day 4 (class 8, Wednesday 14June2017)

### Whew! Today was crazy!

Things are starting to go better, thanks to my classmates. I am doing better on my own and needing a little less help, but I have to say that of all the help I've gotten from classmates, James is very good at getting me to the problem but still getting me to figure it out instead of needing to tell me. I am also trying to help other students, although I usually just end up feeling like maybe I confused them more...I am glad that coding seems to have started coming back to me a bit, I don't like being behind and hopefully I can actually get all the MVP's for the assignment done in time to have some brain function left to work on going back over previous assignments to get more points.
