# LJ Code 201 - Day 6 (class 11, Monday 19June2017)

### And another day I couldn't finish my homework in lab...it's not possible to constantly pay an additional $5 for parking to stay late...I barely have time to breathe, eat, and sleep...much less check out public transportation...feeling quite frustrated

Pseudocoding happened today but it still didn't help enough. By the time I got to the difficult part, trying to create objects and put the names/correct images just couldn't happen. Even trying to talk it through with someone didn't work, I just couldn't think straight. I kept losing my train of thought and forgetting what I was saying in the middle of saying it. Sadly, I haven't done regular coding in a few years so my brain seems to get easily burnt out and decides to quit working. I get help, think I know what I'm doing and how to tackle something then 5 minutes later I'm totally lost again. I miss code review. It was valuable time during morning lecture time when my brain is fresher and I could get help and come up with ideas without having to wait until lab when another assignment is looming over my head.
